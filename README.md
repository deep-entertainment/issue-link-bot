# Issue mentions to links bot for Discord

*This repository is deprecated. The public service is not available anymore.**

This litte bot converts mentions of issues on public issue trackers (e.g. Github issue tracker) to links
to the web UIs of them.

It will turn #123 to https://github.com/organization/project/issues/123.

After starting the instance and authorizing the bot, use /setissueurl to set the URL to your issue tracker.
